In a world of supermarkets and global supply chains, there's something revolutionary about neighbors sharing surplus produce. Our Local Food Swap celebrates this simple yet powerful act of community building.

## What is a Food Swap?

A food swap is a community gathering where people bring surplus produce, preserves, seeds, or seedlings to share or trade with others. It's informal, friendly, and open to everyone - whether you bring armfuls of zucchini or just yourself!

### How It Works

The beauty of food swaps is their simplicity:

1. **Bring what you can**: Excess produce from your garden, homemade preserves, fresh eggs, seeds you've saved
2. **Take what you need**: Browse what others have brought and take items that interest you
3. **Share knowledge**: Exchange growing tips, recipes, and gardening wisdom
4. **Build connection**: Meet your neighbors and fellow food growers

## Why Food Swaps Matter

### Reducing Food Waste

Australian households waste approximately 2.5 million tonnes of food every year. When your lemon tree produces more than you can use, sharing that abundance:

- Prevents waste
- Reduces the need for industrial food production
- Keeps nutrients cycling locally

### Strengthening Food Security

Community food systems create resilience by:

- Diversifying where our food comes from
- Reducing dependence on long supply chains
- Building local knowledge about growing food
- Creating networks of mutual support

### Celebrating Seasonal Abundance

Food swaps reconnect us with seasons and cycles:

- Spring: Lettuce, herbs, peas, strawberries
- Summer: Tomatoes, zucchini, basil, stone fruit
- Autumn: Pumpkins, apples, figs, leafy greens
- Winter: Citrus, brassicas, root vegetables

## Seed Saving: The Gift That Keeps Giving

Our swap will also feature seed exchange! Saving and sharing seeds:

- Preserves varieties adapted to local conditions
- Maintains genetic diversity
- Passes on living heritage
- Empowers food sovereignty

### Seeds to Look For:

- Heirloom tomatoes suited to coastal growing
- Local adapted beans and peas
- Hardy greens that withstand Wollongong's climate
- Native food plants and bush tucker species

## Beyond the Swap: Building Community

Food swaps create ripples that extend far beyond the event:

- **Skill Sharing**: Learn preserving, fermenting, and seed saving techniques
- **Resource Sharing**: Swap tools, equipment, and growing spaces
- **Problem Solving**: Get help with pest problems, soil issues, or challenging growing conditions
- **Friendship**: Build genuine connections with people who share your values

## What to Bring

First-timers often wonder what to contribute. Here are ideas:

### From the Garden:
- Fresh produce (washed and presented nicely)
- Potted seedlings or cuttings
- Saved seeds (labeled with variety and growing info)
- Herbs bundled together

### Homemade Items:
- Jams, chutneys, and preserves
- Pickles and ferments
- Dried herbs or herb blends
- Baked goods (especially using local ingredients)

### Even If You Don't Garden:
- Come and participate! Many swappers are happy to share
- Bring questions and enthusiasm
- Offer to help organize future swaps

## Starting Your Own Food Swap

Inspired to start a swap in your neighborhood? It's easier than you think:

1. Choose a regular time and place (community hall, park, someone's driveway)
2. Spread the word through local Facebook groups, community noticeboards
3. Keep it simple - tables, people, food
4. Make it regular (monthly is common)
5. Build it slowly - community takes time
