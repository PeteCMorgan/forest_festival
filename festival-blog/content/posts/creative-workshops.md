Art and nature have always been intertwined. At our festival, local artists will share their practices, inviting participants of all ages and abilities to explore creativity through pottery, natural pigments, and earth-based art making.

## The Artists

We're honored to feature talented local artists who draw deep inspiration from our coastal landscape and native bushland. Their workshops are designed to be accessible, playful, and deeply connected to place.

## Pottery Workshop: Shaping Earth

### Working with Clay

Our pottery workshop introduces the ancient art of working with clay - the same material our landscape is made from. You'll:

- Learn basic hand-building techniques (no wheel required!)
- Create functional pieces or sculptural forms
- Explore textures inspired by bark, leaves, and coastal patterns
- Connect with the meditative process of shaping earth

### What You'll Make

Participants can create:

- Small pinch pots or bowls
- Garden markers or plant labels
- Decorative tiles
- Sculptural pieces inspired by native plants or animals

**No experience needed** - the focus is on process, play, and connection rather than perfection.

## Natural Pigments & Art Making

### Colors from the Land

Learn to create art using materials gathered sustainably from the landscape:

- Charcoal from burnt wood
- Ochres and clay pigments
- Plant-based dyes and inks
- Natural binders and mediums

### Creating Together

This workshop explores:

- Making marks inspired by natural patterns
- Creating collaborative art pieces
- Experimenting with different techniques
- Responding to the landscape around us

## Why Art Matters in Community Building

Creative workshops do more than teach techniques - they:

### Build Connection

- Between people who might not otherwise meet
- Across ages and backgrounds
- Through shared creative experience

### Deepen Relationship with Place

- Observing patterns, textures, colors in nature
- Using local materials mindfully
- Expressing our connection to Country through art

### Foster Wellbeing

- Creative practice reduces stress and anxiety
- Working with hands is grounding and present
- Making art builds confidence and joy

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Our workshops are designed for **everyone**:

- No artistic experience required
- Adaptable for different abilities and needs
- Child-friendly (under supervision)
- Materials and guidance provided
- Come and go as you please

## The Role of Art in Sustainability

Art helps us:

- **See differently**: Notice details we usually miss
- **Value materials**: Appreciate the beauty in simple, local resources
- **Question consumption**: Create rather than consume
- **Tell stories**: Share what matters to us
- **Imagine futures**: Envision the world we want to create

## Natural Materials & Traditional Knowledge

We acknowledge that many art-making practices using natural materials have deep roots in Aboriginal cultural practice. Our workshops honor this by:

- Respecting cultural protocols around materials and knowledge
- Gathering materials sustainably and with permission
- Centering care for Country in our creative practice
- Learning from place rather than imposing external ideas

## What to Bring

- Yourself and your curiosity!
- Comfortable clothes that can get a bit messy
- A water bottle
- Any special tools or materials you like to work with (optional)

## What We Provide

- All basic materials and tools
- Guidance from experienced artists
- A welcoming, judgment-free space
- Connection to community and landscape

## Taking It Further

After the festival, consider:

- Joining local art groups or classes
- Starting a nature journal practice
- Exploring your own area for natural art materials
- Teaching children or friends what you've learned
- Supporting local artists by following their work and buying local

## The Joy of Making

In a world that often values product over process, we're creating space for:

- Slow, mindful making
- Learning through experimentation
- Celebrating imperfection
- Finding beauty in simplicity

**Come get your hands dirty, your mind quiet, and your creativity flowing!**
