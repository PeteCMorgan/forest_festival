At the Common Grounds Community Festival, we're excited to introduce our community to **syntropic agriculture** - a revolutionary approach to regenerative farming that works with nature, not against it.

## What is Syntropic Agriculture?

Syntropic agriculture is a method of farming that mimics natural forest ecosystems. Instead of fighting against nature's processes, it harnesses them to create abundant, self-sustaining food systems.

### Key Principles

- **Layered Planting**: Just like a natural forest, syntropic systems use multiple vertical layers - from ground covers to canopy trees
- **Succession Planning**: Plants are chosen to support each other through different growth stages
- **Soil Regeneration**: Constant mulching and plant diversity builds rich, living soil
- **Water-Wise Practices**: Deep-rooted plants and organic matter help retain moisture

## What You'll Learn at Our Workshop

Our hands-on permaculture workshop will guide you through:

1. Understanding forest layers and how to replicate them
2. Selecting plants that work together synergistically
3. Building healthy soil through composting and mulching
4. Designing your own food forest, no matter how small your space

## Why This Matters for Our Community

In coastal Wollongong, we face unique challenges - salt spray, sandy soils, and changing rainfall patterns. Syntropic agriculture offers solutions that:

- Build resilience against climate extremes
- Reduce water usage while increasing yields
- Create habitat for native wildlife
- Sequester carbon and cool our local environment

## Join Us

Whether you're an experienced gardener or just starting out, our workshop is designed to be accessible and engaging. You'll leave with practical knowledge you can apply in your own backyard, balcony, or community garden.

**No experience necessary - just bring your curiosity and love for the land!**
