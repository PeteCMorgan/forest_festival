The Lookout property sits on the edge of one of Australia's oldest national parks, bordered by rich sub-tropical rainforest and coastal vegetation communities. Our bush regeneration tours will take you on a journey through this remarkable landscape.

## A Unique Ecosystem

Otford sits at a biodiversity hotspot where multiple vegetation communities meet:

- **Coastal Escarpment Forest**: Dominated by hardy species adapted to salt spray and strong winds
- **Sub-tropical Rainforest**: Remnants of ancient rainforest with towering palms and ferns
- **Littoral Rainforest**: Rare coastal forest adapted to sandy soils and salt exposure

## What Makes This Land Special

On Dharawal Country, this area has been cared for by Traditional Custodians for thousands of years. The vegetation tells stories of:

- Deep cultural connections to plants for food, medicine, and materials
- Resilience in the face of European clearing and development
- Natural regeneration when given the chance to recover

## Join Our Guided Tours

Led by experienced local bush regenerators, our tours will help you:

### Identify Native Plants

Learn to recognize local species like:
- Lilly Pilly (*Syzygium* species)
- Bangalow Palm (*Archontophoenix cunninghamiana*)
- Native Ginger (*Alpinia caerulea*)
- Coastal Rosemary (*Westringia fruticosa*)

### Understand Weed Management

Discover techniques for managing invasive species without harming natives:
- Hand removal vs. chemical treatment
- Timing interventions with plant life cycles
- Supporting native regeneration after weed removal

### Practice Erosion Control

Learn how to:
- Stabilize slopes using native plants
- Create swales and contour lines
- Work with water flow instead of against it

## Connecting to Place

Bush regeneration is about more than just pulling weeds. It's about:

- Building relationship with the land we live on
- Supporting biodiversity and ecosystem health
- Creating corridors for wildlife movement
- Honoring the cultural significance of these plants and places

## Practical Skills for Your Own Space

Whether you have a backyard bordering bushland or simply want to plant more natives, you'll leave with knowledge you can apply:

- Choosing appropriate local natives for your conditions
- Creating habitat for birds, insects, and mammals
- Managing your land to reduce fire risk while supporting biodiversity
- Connecting with local Landcare and bushcare groups
